May 19, 2021, roughly around 8:15 PM I was out with my children and was gazing up at the moon than I saw a black object moving slowly across the sky towards the west, coming up quickly behind the object was a jet airline taking off from Hartsfield airport they came so close they could‚Äôve collided.  I thought I was recording the whole incident but when I look down at my phone it wasn‚Äôt filming I missed everything.  I happen to look back up I saw another black object heading west and this time I got the footage.",

It appeared to suck water up into it for about five minutes then sat about 15 to 25 feet above the ground for 15 minutes. It appeared to be about the size of a single seater plane. My dog was shaking and whining the whole time and that's what made me believe that perhaps this was something strange. I asked my wife if she had her phone and she did take pictures. She hasn't sent them to me yet but when she does I'm loading them onto my computer and sending them to you.",

There are no clouds in the sky. I was a little scared so I called a friend, and while on the phone , in the same area of the sky I saw a line of about 6 small bluish lights following each other. I thought that the small ones could be starling as it looked similar but the website says that starlink is not visible in my location for the next 5 days.  When the orbs were disappearing it was as if they were passing behind a wall that wasn‚Äôt there, moving forward and just gone.. I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it.",

   "text": "Bright light in the sky vanishes in seconds I walked out into my back yard and looked up at the sky, looking east. There is nothing obscuring vision here such as trees, buildings, walls, or lights.  There was a noticeably bright light in the sky, not directly overhead, but probably at low-flying plane altitude.  It was round and white. Not flashing. It was standing still. My first thought was a plane moving towards me, but it was not blinking. It looked brighter than a planet.  After around 5 seconds, it slowly moved North and gradually became dimmer until it only looked like a distant star. This went on for about 10 seconds before it disappeared completely.  Skywatching is a hobby of mine and I have excellent vision, even at night. I have seen hundreds of planes, and this was not one. There was no visible plane body, nor were there blinking lights.  At that altitude, I should have been able to clearly read the words \"UPS\" or \"AMAZON\" if it were a plane. If it were at a higher altitude, it would need to be tremendously bright. Even then, planes at ~20,000 still blink.  There was actually an airplane nearby at the same time. The plane looked as a normal plane should...with blinking lights and a visible body, making a distant sound as it moved. It was farther away, moving sort of South-West.  If I put my hand up to the sky, it was probably about a finger's length below the UFO and slightly to the right of it. It was very easy to see the difference between the crafts.  Weird things are seen here quite often and my family and I have reported crafts in this area before. We have photos and video of others, but not this one.",

I was about a mile from entering the city when I look up to my right into the horizon it was a clear nigth and could see what it appear as a long tail of falling debrie. I could not hear any sound of any kind. At first I thought I was witnessing either a meteorite or space debrie falling. I made a recording of it and mentioned in it that perhaps this was from the Chinese satelite expected to fall. (I did not know that this event had already occurred  days earlier). So as I got closer to town I lost the sitting with the city lights now glowing so I decided to make a turn towards the crop fields were is dark to have a better view of the sitting. To my surprise once I stopped on the side of the road and look up; there was a string oof white and orange round lights probably about 12 or more all lined up moving east I began video with my cellphone. I was able to capture some of the lights i! n the distance. Then I noticed that at particular point in an open space on the horizon the lights were entering and disappearing one by one till they were gone this must have last for about 30 seconds. I noticed that as the lights were entering this wormhole or what it ever it was, their shape changed from round to straight like a cigar. Very strange never have I seen anything like this except in the movies but after experiencing this first hand I have to admit there is definitely evidence of something outthere that needs closer examination.",

The travel pattern of both sightings was from north ward to southward direction. The position of where this was seen from my location :  the moon  was at my back and the big dipper was to the east (or one of the pots of the dippers) of the moon using the second star in the big dipper handle  which was facing east and holding my arms in the air  keeping them about 20inches apart and in line with the handle of the big dipper I was able to try to provide my brother with a general area to look.  He did not see anything and stated his skies were hazy.  I was definitely in shock to witness such an event, as it defies what is know about objects traveling in the air, things just don't stop and change directions and then sped up and slow down.  I am unsure of what I may have witnessed but I witnessed something.",

I casually glanced over the top of my Nieghbor‚Äôs house and I saw at least 7 green dots in a perfect line and moving very fast across the sky. I yelled to my wife ‚Äúlook look look‚Äù she was in shock. She took my phone and took pictures. The objects were moving so fast they were very quickly out of our line of sight. We ran in the house and exited through the front door to get a better vantage point from the street. When we came outside there was 2 men outside my home talking (no relation). When the men saw how we came out the house and how we were reacting to something in the sky one of them asked me ‚Äú what are you looking at?‚Äù When I pointed it out he was in shock and started to take pictures his friend did the same. At this point the object were getting very far away and very small. The objects were bright green very bright constant green light no blinking. They were very close! together and in what looked like a perfect line. They were moving in sync with each other.",

It was a little patchy cloud so they seemed to be blinking on & off, but they were in a crescent shape, not a line like I've seen images of. The whole thing subtended only about 4 or 5¬∞.

Light was a little less than the apparent brightness of Venus, traveling at a high altitude about forty degrees above the horizon. The sky was still light enough that no stars were yet visible, though the crescent moon was clearly apparent in the southwest sky.  Had time to grab my binoculars from my car. Through the binoculars, the light appeared to be a single steady point of light with no colored navigation lights or strobing.  The light traveled in a straight line, moving at a steady speed from the southeast toward the northeast. It was visible for at least 90 seconds before fading in the distance. I thought it might have been the ISS, but checking with tracking apps showed the ISS wasn't due to be visible in my location in the NORTHWEST sky until several hours later.",

I watched a rectangle shaped ship go from the bottom of the moon that was lit up by the sun and up to the dark part of the moon. The ufo moved very quick and traveled the surface of the moon in about 3 seconds. I also noticed it was fairly bigger than most of the craters on the moon and it left a shading on the ground as it traveled. I came to the conclusion it must have been massive for me to see it as i did. It had the shape of a rectangle if you rounded off its edges and thinned out the front of it.It caught me off guard so i didnt get many detailed on it but it was dark like black or smokey gray.The ufo had no lights nore did it leave a trail. I watched for several hours after that to see it it would come back around se! eing as it moved so fast but never did. I use the telescope alot to take a look at the moon. its a decent telescope and like i said i get really really close detail to the surface and never seen anything pass by the moon like that or that size or even leaving a shadow on the surface. It was pretty interesting. I sometimes see wierd things fly by but you can tell its usually something in our own atmosphere so i kno the difference between the two. Feel free to contact me.",

   "text": "15 crafts in space that raced, darted, faded in and out, pretended to be stars, and wobbled in all directions in the sky. This evening my daughter and I had been out feeding bottle lambs in the field.  We had to get them back to the rest of the flock and also sneak away so they would not follow us.  They think we are their moms, but if they cannot find us then they will stay with the rest of the sheep and the guardian dog where they will be safe.  The sun had just gone down completely so it was hard to see so we used that to our advantage to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù. We walked through the flock of sheep and circled around to walk along the fence knowing they cannot see that well and will loose us in the other sheep if we walk quickly.  As we circled around to the entrance of the field I heard a couple of stray bottle lambs calling so we stopped.  We have 13 of them and the smallest ones are harder to escape from.  If we kept going they would have made us so we waited.  I was counting on that they would eventually follow the direction we had left them and also the sound of the other sheep be! cause they don‚Äôt want to be left behind.  We stood there quietly listening for a few minutes as they called to the sheep and made their way towards the flock.  I got bored quickly and started looking at the stars while still listening to the lambs as they made their way.  I quickly noticed a formation of small lights that were very high in the sky. They were moving steadily from east to west.  We live near an airport so I first just assumed they were high altitude planes. They were moving at that speed, maybe a bit faster.  Then quickly realized they were not flashing at all, several high altitude planes did appear and it was easy to tell that was not what we were looking at.  As I mentioned we live near an airport and there is a lot of air traffic.  So, then I thought they must be satellites.  Though,  I thought it was odd they were in a trapezoid formation.  I pointed them out to my daughter who was with me.  She is 13 and she started watching them too.  Then I realized there was 5 in formation then another two out front and then another two appear towards the rear.  They traveled at a mostly steady rate and constant light.  Then! my daughter said, ‚Äúdid you see that?‚Äù  I said, ‚Äúno what?‚Äù  She said the one I the rear of the trapezoid was doing something strange.  So, I focused on the one and saw that is was actually wobbling.  Moving up and down as it was tracking with the others.  She said yes it is, but that‚Äôs not what she saw.  She said it had flirted around really fast.  So I kept watching and then I saw it too.  It would zip at light speed backward or in another direction for just a split second.  Sometimes so fast it just looked like it just faded out or disappeared and flash behind  it appeared then it was back. This happened In different directions, not always behind.  So that solidified they were not satellites either.  For reference these moved across half the sky in no more than 5 minutes then stopped after we were commenting on them.  After they stopped I pulled out my phone and checked my star app and it said that I was looking at the constellation Leo.  The ‚Äústars‚Äù did line up with it b! ut, unless stars now forget their place and cross half the sky! in five minutes to get back in place and they also wobble and flit around while they do it... THEY WERE NOT STARS. We realized they were pretending to be stars and that was the reason for he formation.  Yet, even then after they stopped the back ‚Äústar‚Äù was still moving around in the sky not holding still.  We were now alert that things were not as they seemed and we stated looking at some other ‚Äústars and satellites‚Äù. The two in front of the formation were no longer visible.  The two behind the trapezoid formation had kept moving after those stopped and then one just faded out and disappeared. The brighter one kept going for a minute then stopped. We turned around and saw two bright lights over one of our big oaks out in the field.  They were so bright I thought those ones HAD to be planes so we watched for a minute.  They never did flash and didn‚Äôt get closer or farther away.  Other airplanes headed for the airport  flew by and it was clear they were not planes.  I checked my star app and it said it was part or Aries. Then the lower one started to quickly drop  in the sky and first faded out, and then  brightened back up and got so low it disappeared behind the tree.  At this point I messaged my husband and told him we were surrounded by UFOs and he came out on the quad to se! e what was going on. Then the higher one started moving quickly across the sky at a steady rate to the south.  When we commented on it, it stopped.  When he got he got there we told him what we had seen and he of course didn‚Äôt believe us.  So I pulled out my star app and the ‚Äústar‚Äù that had been in Aries was now saying it was part of Apus.  So the ‚Äústar‚Äù had ‚Äúflown‚Äù past Cygnus and into some harp constellation I had never heard of before.  I told him just wait a minute and watch.  Sure enough, soon my daughter spotted another ‚Äústar‚Äù obviously dancing around in the sky.  It was not a part of the original fleet but in a similar part of the sky.  We all watched it weave and swing and dip every which way. Then the bright star behind the trapezoid formation started moving again towards the ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù trapezoid formation which was still holding still. Then another ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù started moving west to east in the same part of the sky.  Joey said for sure THAT ONE was satellite, until half way across the sky it disappeared.  At this this point his mind was pretty blown but I said, ‚ÄúI bet there are more‚Äù so we turned around to the north again and ANOTHER light I had taken for granted as star started dancing around too!  So, we watched that for a minute or two as it dipped and weaved around.  Then we turned back around to the south and I looked suspiciously at ‚ÄúLeo.  I took out my star app out again and their cover was blown because while they no longer lined up with ! ‚Äúleo‚Äù! They had not moved with the constellation as it would move.  The ‚Äústar‚Äù furthest east no longer lined up at all.  They accidentally held too still!  At this point my daughter and I had been out there watching this craziness for darn near an hour, and I had to get back in to get the little kids to bed and what not.  We headed back toward the house.  Then I remembered I had not given one of our guardian dogs her medicine so I went up to the barn to do that.  I noticed she need water so went out to fill her bucket and while it was filling I looked up at the sky again to see another very bright ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù booking it across the sky faster than any of the other had been until my view was blocked by the barn roof above me.  I checked for the ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù stars on the way down tot he house and they were still there, still pretending to be a constellation, but even further out of line of where the actual constellation was supposed to be in the sky.  I am 38 years old, I have never before seen anything that I could not write off as an airplane or satellite in the sky.  I don‚Äôt drink and have never so much as smoked a cigarette since they are my number 1 asthma trigger. I have an undergraduate degree in environmental science, and a master‚Äôs degree in biology.  I own and operate a 127 acre sustainable and regenerative farm with grass only beef cattle, sheep, goats, turkeys, chickens, and ducks.  I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time looking for UFOs, nor do I have time to even if I wanted.  But, I sit here now wondering how many times have a I looked up at stars were not actually stars?  Why would UFOs pretend to be stars or constellations?  What is the purpose?  These questions disturb me nearly as much as the fact that I have witnessed indisputable UFOs.   What are they doing and why are they pretending?  And why SOOO Many!???  Just, why???",

I then glanced at the area through my nvgs to attempt to see of there was anything not visible to the eye alone, and in the background there were several orbs of light that appeared much farther up traveling in a straight diagonal line all appearing to be equally spaced, they also appeared to pass through some sort of \"barrier\" becoming no longer visible at the exact same spot. Very strange I have never been interested in this type of extraterrestrial stuff or any of the sort,  but I have to admit! I have been consumed by curiosity.

This is when I realized it was spherical and silver, although it also seemed to be reflecting the light surrounding it. It had to be at least 15-20,000 ft high. I continued to observe it while walking to my car, which was facing the direction it was coming from. It continued to move straight forward at a high speed.

I could not make sense of it and called my three friends over, who all saw it and were just as taken back by it, with complete inability to explain what it could possibly be. It was fairly large at first and got smaller as it slowly moved away towards the mountains. It had approximately 10 small sqaure looking white lights on it; far enough apart to be distinguished from one another, but too close together to possibly be multiple satellites.  The lights appeared to rotate. I managed to get a photo, but it was much further away at this point.

Around 10:36pm (22:36). my son spotted the very long, illuminated  craft (\"Um guys, WHAT IS THAT!?\"), in the northern sky, heading west to east.  From our location, it was maybe 30 degrees up from the horizon.  We left the campfire and quickly got our phones out to record it; the pics are poor unfortunately.  It was moving slowly, and wasn't bright.  Knowing that it wasn't an airplane, I flashed it a few times with a green laser, just in case it might react.  It did not.  I believe the craft was moving at a very high altitude.  It reminded me of the SpaceX rocket re-entry, but wasn't breaking apart.  I'm very familiar with stargazing, and we had just watched the ISS fly by (which had a -4.0 brightness = very bright!) and we had also watched starlink satellites fly over as well.

The first words uttered about the object were, \"Is that a train?\". Moments later the bar of light moved out of the wooded treetops and into the sky (it had been in the sky all along, but was merely obscured by the trees). It was a horizontal flat line of light punctuated by several brighter circular points along the line. How distant the object was was difficult to discern, but seemed to be flying lower than the planes in the night sky, and was 5-8x the size in our field of view. It moved slowly from West to East across the sky. It wasn't long before it began to go from completely horizontal to being at a 45-60 degree angle, without changing its trajectory or movement pattern. It was at some point during this transition that I took the photo, wherein you can see the object at around 30 degrees from its horizontal pos! ition. The camera I used was on a new Samsung phone, which has a low light mode that leaves the shutter open for 3 seconds. The photo appears to show a dark outline, possibly illuminated by similar lights on the other side of the craft.",

Slightly tapered on end closest to me.  And same taper it seemed at other end.  Moving consistent speed.  I thought, well, that's probably a plane lining up for Medford Airport but as it traveled slightly North-NorthEast at a consistent speed, there was never a single light  blinking or otherwise as with an airplane.  Nor shape of a tail or wings.  And since I live in an area close to an airport, I have never seen a plane in a clear sky without a single light flashing at some point.   And it almost appeared that the illumination might have been from the city lights of the Rogue Valley cities below and to East of object.  Maybe not.  The entire sighting was 1 and 1/2 minutes tops at 10:35pm.    Clear sky, some stars visible although there was immediate light pollution in area.  Object elevation?   Hard to say.  Perhaps 7 to 10,000ft?   If so, object would have been several hundred feet long.  At least a couple hundred.   No apparent change of course.

   "text": "Ball shaped uap over northeast Houston in broad daylight. My mother and I were sitting outside enjoying a beautiful day. It was pleasant for Texas and partially cloudy so we got to take advantage of my lounge chairs that lean all the way back. Since we had some clouds you could see very clearly into the sky because there wasn't blinding sunlight. It was around 2 in the afternoon. I watch the flight paths of planes coming into Bush International Airport regularly and enjoy monitoring jets, birds, whatever. I had been watching the birds when a black object caught my eye. It was moving in a straight line (unlike birds). It was also too high for birds. Just skirting the low lying cloud bottoms. It appeared to be round and black. No wings. No contrails (wasn't high enough for that anyway). It almost looked like a black basketball but considering how high it was, it had to be decent sized. Someone would have to do the math but I guess it would be the size of a smart car? It was moving at a good clip but not blinding spee! d. It slowed for a second and then returned to full speed. Very straight perfect line. I alerted my Mom and started to point and that's about the time it disappeared behind some branches on our magnolia. She sorta laughed thinking I was being silly. I went inside to get a cup of coffee. When I came back out my mom was standing and staring in the direction I originally saw the ball. She said \"You aren't going to believe this but I just saw it.\" Same situation, it had just disappeared in that same area going southeast towards Lake Houston and the Eastgate/Huffman area. It seemed to be coming at regular intervals and sticking with the same heading, speed and altitude. I have no way of knowing if it was the same object or three different ones. It came along one more time, we both saw it and I grabbed my cell phone but couldn't get it on the viewfinder. Shortly after the last sighting a Chinook looking military helicopter flew by at 2:23. I did get that on video. It fl! ew right over our street and was heading south. It was not a b! ird. It had no wings. It didn't make any sound that we could hear. It was in broad daylight and the sun was slightly behind us. We were not blinded and had a perfect view.",

Just slowly moving in straight line from West to the East. I moved further outside to watch it and it slowly moved in that perfect straight line and then poof and it was gone. My dog was being weird and waits for me to call her in but when she was done she ran into the house. And in the morning she refused to go outside at 6:00 am her normal time for 10+ yrs. later today she keeps barking towards the same area. There is now why it was a satalite satellite cuz it was so low and so big. Very strange and no noise either. Of course I did not bring my phone with cuz it was so early",

Being approximately 9:00pm PDT I arrived in my driveway. In accordance to a compass, my driveway faces the front of my house to the north, and the back of my house facing towards the south. My property being centered from street light illumination, allowed the 05/13/2021 clear night sky to appear even more crisp with clarity. As I left my vehicle, walking towards the east, my eyes trailing the night sky came to a violent holt. Frozen in my steps I paused. An object of great vibrant color changing illumination completely silent, hovering in one location to the north east in accordance to my house position.  30 minutes has passed, comparing the object to the east edge of my house, my reference point has not changed. Completely still in the same location the object has not changed position in reference to the edge of my house. As minutes passed, I watched the object display multiple patterns of bright polluting light. Giving off different shapes with each sequence of color change in random grouped order. The lights displayed pure radiant energy.  Completely amazed and in utter disbelief, I realize that the object is nothing I have ever witnessed in my entire life. After an hour of constant display, I left my reference point and rushed into my house. Frantically gathering my aunt and cousin. Rushing back to my reference point, the object has only changed its pulsing display of color.  Ruling out possible explanations of the object being a plane, helicopter, and or drone. Two hours has passed and the objects stillness questions who revolves around who. My aunt and cousin speechless with confusion. All I want is a closer look. My aunt leaves to return with a pair of binoculars. Winding the focus lense my jaw drops. Centered in my view the object forced vibrant light in split seconds. Red flash, elongated speckled light triangle, green flash, speckled hexagon diamond, blue flash, assortment of speckled lines, white flash, solid speckled perimeter, yellow flash, center and trip to tip. The arrangement has no pattern but a sequence of shapes and mixed colors.  The object hasn‚Äôt alone. Passing off the pair of binoculars hand by hand, the dazzling shapes and colors was the beginning. In split seconds the color arrangement seized to only a white center orb with a perimeter of white sequenced dots. In this seize of color, four small pin point objects arranged outward from the Initial object and disappeared in all directions. Coming up on 3 hours of the objects fixed position, the color display begins again only in completely different arrangements. Passing from the west to the east, a raising humb of an airplanes engine crosses paths with the object. Reviling the sheer size and blinding illumination compared to the plane‚Äôs signal lights. The altitude of the object is unknown but obvious to sit higher then the planes flight path.  It has been 3 hours and the objects position begins to change. Seemingly to roll across the sky, the object appears flat, in a slow sweep right to left the object is gone from view 3 hours has passed and it is now 12:00am. The Dazzling color show so quick to end only leaves the dark absence of night in its untouched position.",

   "text": "Cancer and Grey Beings Ok, so this is my second encounter, I reached out to you with the first one and we spoke. The first one happened in Lexington when I was a child and I had the UFO right above me. This time I had 4 beings examining me.  On April 21st I was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on my sacrum. This encounter happened shortly after that. It's hard to talk about this because they were in my house, when I saw the UFO at least it was outside, I was scared then too, but this seems crazy. I don't know what to feel.  I woke up to see 4 beings, I couldn't move and my wrist and ankles felt like they were bound but there was nothing there visually. I was laying on my right said so my back was to a wall. There were 2 beings kneeling on my bed looking over my body at my back. One had a cylinder he was moving up and down my back, the second one seemed to be watching, like they were examining me. There was one standing close to my feet watching to 2 examining me. The one closest to me, saw me open my eyes. He nodded his head at me, then he touched one that was bent over me. He looked up and got off the bed. All 4 kind of nodded at me like they were saying it's ok. They then backed out of my room and faded into the darkness of my hallway and were gone. My body became free as the left.  I was scared and tried to get the lights on quickly but they were gone. They were short, maybe 4'5 - 5'0. They had a larger head but not like you see on movies. They were almost proportional. No hair, large eyes, small nose, small mouth, and no ears. Their bodies looked strong, like lean muscle. Their skin was a dark gray but when they were in the dark hall, there was a dark dark forest green tent as they faded away.  I had a hard time going back to sleep but, I got to thinking maybe they didn't mean to scare me, maybe they were just interested in the tumor. Maybe they were trying to help me or something. So with that I was able to relax a little. They didn't hurt me, it's just scary to wake up and find 4 beings in your bedroom. I don't know why I would have an encounter as a child and then have one at this point in life. Maybe they are just watching me. I just don't know what to think.  However, it got even stranger, I wasn't going to tell anyone what happened because I just thought it was so abnormal. You know why me. But my roommate that morning said \"Did you have someone in the house last night, Gwen (the dog) seemed to be really upset.\" So, I broke down and told him what happened. He said he woke up for a moment and thought he saw a small person going towards my room  So, I don't know what was going on - but it is very very unbelievable. Have you ever had a report about an encounter with someone with cancer.",

My husband and I received a series of notifications (thru the security cam app we use) regarding motions detected, but he seemed to be ignoring them though. I checked the security cam 1 and viewed it live. It seemed like something was interfering with it. I shared the live cam with my husband, but he said they were spider webs. Below is one of the video clips that I saved on my phone. More than 4 bright lights/or light reflections started moving sporadically later in the recordings, while 3 of them, shaped like small squares, were vertically aligned at the top left of the video. I think the video below was recorded at 5:25 am. I stopped the recording at about 5:45 am, and those unidentified sporadic bright lights were still hovering ne! ar or by the security cam 1. I'm assuming this event lasted about an hour, because at around 6 am, the sun generally starts to rise. I also noticed in one of the recorded clips, a bunch of raccoons were running across the other side of the street towards where the dumpster is and away from our driveway.",

At first I didnt think anything of it since MacDill airforce base is located a few miles south from Gandy, in the direction I was headed.  But the speed of these aircraft was much faster than when you see a plane flying overhead.  Because of the oak trees that line Bayshore Blvd, my view was blocked for the next few streets until I turned onto Gandy.  I really was interested to see the aircraft again, but there was nothing in the sky anywhere.  I doubt these were military aircraft but I thought important to report this sighting of something that I suspect was UFO.  I hope this is helpful.",

It had the ability to go the full distance of the sky in mere seconds. This was no shooting star for it did not quickly vanish nor was it a low altitude airplane like craft. We could barely make out the shape before it cut short immediately, lowered slowly at a 90 degree rate and disappeared behind some clouds. I went back out each night hoping to see something similar. And on 5/12 I saw a \"star\" making similar movements but this time it was much closer to the ground. It was changing direction and getting closer almost as if it noticed me.

Their speeds were not perfectly constant in relation to each other as they seemed to speed up/slow down. That's all i've got.

Then it reappeared, then another, then all three  From my perspective, they were not in a line nor triangle and were at different altitudes.  I estimate below 3 thousand feet, the height normally helicopters are seen at.  The objects did not have any navigation lights and there was no sound. I tried to catch a movie.  I thought I was taking a movie and even zoomed in enough to see a hexagonal structure in the center.  It turns out I wasn‚Äôt recording.  Too much inexperience and adrenaline.  Anyway, I got home and sat in the driveway looking for them.  While watching after about 3-4 minutes, I see the starlink line transiting, moving towards the east.

These lights appeared at a point or origin approximately 30 degrees above the horizon from my location. The lights made no sound, and moved at the same rate equidistant from each other. Approx 4 to five lights would appear, on after the other, all moving north in a straight line in succession before the first light or lead light would fade out abruptly, then another would appear at the point of origin. They appeared to move at an upward angle - not falling like a meteorite or aircraft flare. I witnessed no aircraft and the brightness was about equivalent to the evening stars in the sky. I went inside and grabbed my phone and told my wife to come outside. The lights were still appearing as we came outside the house and I pointed them out to my wife who confirmed what I saw. The lights conti! nued to appear for another 4 minutes before fading away altogether. During this sighting, the point of origin did not appear to move. I was able to capture about 2:55 min worth of video before the lights faded.  I was a witness to the Phoenix Lights many years ago and I remember how they seemed to hover in the air. These lights moved rapidly.",

   "text": "116 orbs in total traveling the three groups equally spaced apart and traveling at the same speed not following the horizon My wife and I were camping at Bothe-Napa, sitting around the campfire looking up at the stars off and on. The sky was very clear, and through the tree openings we first spotted a row of orbs (same size as a singular satellite you would see cruising by). There were 8 orbs on the first pass, equally distanced apart from each other moving at the exact same speed from left to right, about 6 to 7 seconds apart from each other.  After the 8 orbs passed and brief moment went by before another another row of orbs began traveling along the same path. Each equally distanced from each other and moving at the same speed. We counted 49 orbs in this group. There were many trees so we could not see beginning or end of their travel (this info will come into play later).  After another brief moment a third group of orbs appeared only this time they were traveling perfectly perpendicular to the previous groups. Again, each equally distanced and moving at the same speed. At this point I decided I would walk into the road/parking lot area to try and get a better look away from the trees. I asked our camp neighbor if he was seeing them as well. I pointed up and he said yes and took out his phone to record a video, but cell phones are just not powerful enough to see lights in the dark night sky. He said he couldn‚Äôt see it on his phone. He seemed much less impressed than myself about what we were seeing and went back to cleaning dishes.  Now here is where it gets interesting‚Ä¶As I followed the trail of traveling orbs I noticed that they did not follow the horizon and disappear as a satellite would. Rather, they travelled in a perfectly straight pathway out of the atmosphere, disappearing from sight as they got far enough away. It was something I had never seen before, like something you would see in a sci-fi movie.  There were 59 orbs traveling on the third perpendicular run. All in all 116 total orbs spotted by the naked eye. It by far the most unexplainable, bizarre, yet interesting thing I have ever seen. I would be interested to know if others saw what we saw that night.",

A moment later my wife went inside to tell our older son. They came out to watch the last dozen or so lights disappear at the same spot in the sky. All of the lights seemed to be the same brightness traveling in almost a straight line but not perfectly. The closest thing I could relate it to would be if a stationary aircraft were to shoot tracers in the sky at something else in the sky and the tracers burnt out at the exact location without fading out but instantly extinguishing at the same point! in the sky and the \"tracers\" did not fall due to gravity in fact they seemed to follow a very straight path. I have been in Marine Corps aviation for 20 years and have flown in large formations but never in a straight line like that. I was a crew chief on CH-46's and MV-22's and performed air to ground and air to air gunnery and we would never shoot air to air in any possibly populated area.",

They were evenly spaced and all going about the same speed. I would normally think it would be a satellite, but there were so many of them. This \"parade\" or formation of lights lasted for several minutes, I would say at least 3 minutes. They faded and gradually disappeared as they headed East. There had to be over 100 \"lights\". Eventually they stopped, but it was a very consistent formation, a straight line of lights all flying across the sky (not falling like a meteor, or space debris) They were too far away to see any shape or color Although I am somewhat skeptical of UFO's, I don't disbelieve. This is definitely the first time I have ever made any type of report. My background: I have a college education, am over 60 yrs old and do not drink alcohol or do drugs.",

I saw three stars in the sky and thought it was Orion's belt, but then noticed that were slowly moving southbound towards Lake Ontario.  The three orbs (they just looked like stars, they were very distant) moved along at a constant pace, southbound. Then I noticed another orb appear on the north end of the line, also moving southbound. More orbs started appearing in this fashion in a straight line, steadily moving southbound. When the line was about 5 orbs long, the southmost one would disappear. Approximately 7-10 orbs appeared and travelled along this route until they faded from the sky one by one reaching the \"end\" of the line .  Nothing crazy, just thought it seemed curious and I didn't know what they could be.",

   "text": "ENORMOUS disc-shaped UFO with band of lights spotted 5/6/21 at 22:40 hovering over Lake Lanier (Gainesville, GA) On Thursday, May 6, 2020, my friend and I were fishing on Lake Lanier near Brown‚Äôs Bridge at about 10:40pm on a cloudy evening. We began to see a series of lights passing over in the clouds across the water a good distance from where we were tied down.  I started filming so I could zoom in to see what they were. Suddenly the clouds parted a bit and we could see it was not a series of lighted separate objects, but rather a series of lights around a huge disk-shaped object that was hovering in place. It had one light on the top and a series of lights rotating around the outermost edge. The scale of the object was enormous, particularly given that it was above the furthest edge of the lake from us, all the way across the Chestatee Bay.  I got a text that disrupted my filming, and I looked down at my phone to start it again, but the clouds closed up again and it then disappeared.",

There was no doubt in my mind what I was seeing, I knew. A fleet of UFO's. There was no sound, and they moved in precise order. And they just kept coming. Once they got farther North East, they just simply disappeared. I guessed maybe 50, but I don't know how many I missed before I got outside.

Evenly spaced in a straight line, appeared to be same height as a star but definitely much higher than aircraft. The lights seem to be diffused. There were about a dozen first pass, then slowly one by one faded out in the sky. About 10 minutes later they appeared again near the same star as first sighting, only there were many more this time. Still seeming to be in formation but with a couple of them spaced closer together. There were 30 or more this time which led me to believe maybe they were flying in a large circle. It was hard to decide if it was a large circle or if there were that many more flying in a straight line. No other aircraft visible in the sky at this time however aircraft sighted several minutes after disappearance of sited crafts. The lights did not vary in brightness but they were not as bright as aircraft or stars. I was looking NW when i first spotted them.",

It's speed was variable and it's excelleration was uneven sometimes quite fast then stationery and it's path also would wobble at times. As a pilot of various aircraft I know of no such capability for the movements observed by any man made craft including drones at the altitude observed. Being that the object was at a extremely high altitude no discernable shape was observed. The objects movements were it's only distinguishing  characteristics from the other observed objects being stars, planets and satellites. The night sky was perfectly clear and No obscurations w! ere present. A number of satellites moved in the object's area but their tracks were straight and constant in contrast to the object observed.

   "text": "Very long, straight craft with string of bright lights on it seen moving slowly in night sky near Williams Arizona. Sighting details: At approximately 2130hrs on May 5th, 2021, I was taking a walk through a very dimly lit RV park one mile East of Williams Arizona. I happened to look upwards and was immediately startled to notice a nearly perfect straight line of bright white lights stretched horizontally across the sky. As I stopped to look intently upon them I noticed they were slightly brighter white than the stars that were clearly visible in the dark night sky. These lights emitted a constant stream of light and did not have the ‚Äútwinkling‚Äù effect that stars frequently have. The string of lights seemed to be equally spaced from one another, horizontally, but were slightly higher/lower from one another vertically. The lights appeared to all be attached to the same craft, as I could just barely make out a very faint appearance of a gray object against the black sky background. The moment I first saw the light formation it appeared to be stationary, but within a few seco! nds all the lights began to slowly move to my right, in unison with each other. They continued at the same very slow speed until out of sight. I‚Äôm not exactly certain of my directional bearings at the time, but I am fairly certain it was moving from the Southwest towards the Northeast in direction. The string of lights was very long. I looked up at about 30 degrees to my left, and it spanned to about 30 degrees to my right. That was my full field of view, due to some tall Ponderosa Pine trees blocking my view of either end of it. I could clearly see approximately 15 lights in a straight line on the object, but there appeared to be more that were being blocked by the trees. It was a very quiet night outside that evening and there was no audible noise coming from this craft. My background: I am 61 years old. I am retired from the US Air Force. I worked on fighter jets as a maintenance technician. I have a BS degree in Psychology from Grand Canyon University, an Associates Degree in Aerospace Technology, and completed half of the credits needed towards a Masters Degree in Family Counseling from Phoenix Seminary.",

They were white and circular flying in a linear pattern flying at high speeds. 30 or so of them became in view of the naked eye one by one and were all gone in a matter of 5 minutes.  They had to be flying at high speeds to disappear so quickly.  My wife and I have never seen anything like it.  I typically see satellites orbiting the earth, but nothing compares to what we witnessed last night.  I have a background in finance, while my wife is a registered nurse.",

I ran outside with both my glasses and binocs but didn't need them because there they were, 10-12 similar objects, flying one in front of the other going north, no sound, but lights under each one. They were just flying in sequence, going north towards Fallon, following the same trajectory that jets from Lemoore to Fallon follow. They were soundless, there were other aircraft in the sky close enough to see this spectacle but I see no mention of it on the internet. H! owever, it is similar to one sighting in the April sightings near the east coast of the USA but the difference is they were all staying the same altitude and in formation like Canadian geese with lights under their bodies. Please someone tell me they were drones? Not likely.",

   "text": "Row of lights moving together silently through the sky On Tuesday, May 4, 2021, at approximately 9:30pm, my partner and I were outside enjoying a fire in our fire pit when I noticed very strange lights out of the corner of my eye. We both then looked up and saw a row of lights floating through the sky. There were many small lights moving together, all a part of one object silently moving through the sky. The lights were not in an even pattern and were steady as it moved through the sky. My partner and I ran to the front of the house to continue watching it as it moved. It passed over the nearby hill and disappeared into the darkness, as if designed to easily blend in at night.  My camera on my phone was not strong enough to pick up the lights, but my partner‚Äôs phone was. The image does not show the details of all of the little lights as it looks like a more solid ray of light, but the image does show that there may have been more there than what was visible to the eye. In the photo, you can see a difference in the coloring above the lights, as if coming up to a point. This leads me to believe that the lights were along the edge of the object, flat underneath, and domed to a point on the top.",

   "text": "3 Orbs Planted in the sky like stars but upon video taping were multi colored changing shapes I've seen these same objects multiple days in a row at the D Street Beach in Encinitas, CA, although most of the other nights it was only one of these multi-light shifting orbs, when last night I spotted 3. The three I eventually spotted were rather far out over the ocean‚Äîa few miles and were arranged in a perfect equilateral triangle with the apex the furthest out over the ocean. On other days I've had different friends who also witnessed the object(s) which have looked very similar‚Äîa brightly lit, multi-color orb that hovers and sometimes changes in shape, sometimes expands and contracts. And sometimes it is moving up the coast like a bright light. Before last night, 5/4/21, for the last 10 days, I had noticed only one of these orbs but in the same location, near where the star Sirius in the western night sky, which is also near the constellation Orion. The orb appears planted in the sky at about the same height as the normal flight path of the military he! licopters, or maybe a little higher, (which are out patrolling every single night) but the orbs were unmoving and almost disguised as a star. For a long time I didn‚Äôt notice it because it looked just like a brightly lit star but upon videotaping, it clearly is not a star. I've also videotaped it with helicopters flying past it, too, and it is definitely different than the helicopters. I've witnessed these orbs on different occasions off the coast of San Diego over the ocean, infrequently now for about a year, sometimes playing with the military, sometimes being followed by them, and sometimes much closer than they were last night, but haven‚Äôt made any reports until now. But now the frequency has changed dramatically as they have shown up every night. Last night the orbs were just planted in the sky and the military helicopters were ignoring them. The strange thing is how long they seem to just be planted there without moving‚Äîfar longer than a helicopter or a drone can hover! , totally without sound, and the strangest part was that they‚Äô! ve been planted there for many days in a row. I start to notice them just as the sky gets dark enough. Unfortunately all of my videos are shaky and don‚Äôt show the way the orbs are just planted in the sky but the colors of the objects are dancing and shifting‚Äîyou can see that much. I‚Äôve ordered a new lens and tripod for my camera phone to continue collecting data which is very shocking to me. I was a big skeptic about all of this until I had other witnesses confirm. I fully expect them to be there again tonight. They have stayed in place without moving until I got tired and went home for the evening all of these nights. Last night I don‚Äôt recall missing time but I have had contact experiences in the past. The beach here where I live is very quiet and dark and private with tall hundred foot bluffs behind me. I generally watch the sunset on the beach every night and started seeing strange lights a year ago but for a long time believed it was just the military until some very strange th! ings happened‚Äîlike the orbs sometimes shoot across the sky. I also saw a recent display of 4 or 5 of them together fading in and out disappearing and have that on video as well.",

   "text": "Strange Gray Disk Hovering then shooting up and disappearing.. Good Morning,  Approximately 7:35am to 7:40am I was alerted by my daughter of something strange in the sky. Followed by my son who ran inside to tell me to come outside.  I looked up into the sky to see a strange gray disc like object that was not moving. Just suspended in the air. I saw some of the kids on the bus get out with their phones up and even the bus driver was looking out of his driver side window. I‚Äôm not sure if any of the parents present saw it but at the time my phone was on the charger and my kids had theirs in their pocket.  I‚Äôm pretty sure if any of the kids with their phones up were recording it‚Äôs likely a TikTok by now or some other form of popular media as they‚Äôre all middle school to high school students. The object took off straight up until it disappeared. I have flown in airplanes, crop planes, and helicopters. I own two drones and have some expertise in maneuvers concerning aircraft dynamics, not to say I‚Äôm a scientist but I know enough to accurately state that with the knowledge I have now that no air craft can move that fast going upwards and disappear in literal seconds.  Also, the way this gray disc was hovering made me think it could be spinning slowly, may had some propulsion from either side. The skies are completely blue with hardly any clouds and the fact it didn‚Äôt have wings and remained stationary in the air seems suspect for a craft re-entering Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and is not a balloon or other helium or gas powered object. This was perfectly still except for the small side to side swaying that was almost too precise to be called anything other than stabilizing in the jet stream.  The fact the craft or whatever it was had been able to shoot straight up without moving forward, backwards, or to the side seems impractical. I cannot think of anything else that I know about which can achieve rapid acceleration almost as if breaching the stratosphere and into what I can only speculate is outer space.  I called the local non emergency line and was told I‚Äôm not the first to report it but it‚Äôs likely a military craft or a science project from something.  I don‚Äôt know what else to say about this except I am confused and confounded by what I saw.  What all of us witnessed, honestly. Wish I could be of more assistance.",

   "text": "Bright mini sized moon appeared near dusk in the northern sky for about 5 minutes and then zoomed out of sight Greetings, I‚Äôm an automation specialist and have been working in the field of electronic technology for over 50 years. I am 70 years old. I have seen a few odd things in the sky in my life but this was the most unusual and unexplained.  I‚Äôm reporting this recent sighting because I have seen nothing about it on any news outlet. I was so shocked by what I saw that I thought it would be global news.  This is my account of what I saw in the sky on May 3, 2021 in Brandon, Ms. I was outside in the early evening working on a new front porch addition. I noticed that it was 7:30 pm and looked up to the sky as I was sitting down to see if I could see bats flying overhead. I had noticed bats coming out to eat insects the evening before at that same time and wanted to see if they were out again and they were. As I was looking to the north, I saw a very bright object. I thought maybe it was Venus because it was so bright and big but it was in the wrong place and this object had an odd flare coming out of one side of it almost like a comet trail but very short. It sort of looked like what you would see if you threw paint ball on a flat surface and it splattered a bit in one direction‚Äì round with a few rays and a bit smudged.  When I noticed the flare, I ran inside to get my binoculars and lost a minute or two looking. All I could fine was my oversize pair so I grab them and went back outside. The object was still there and had grown larger but the flare was gone. I tried to focus on it. My binoculars are very large and hard to handle without a mount but I was able to focus on it and I was shocked into disbelief. I had no idea what I was looking at.  It looked like miniature moon about 3 or 4 time the size of Venus as observed from earth and just as bright.  It was bright silver with shaded areas and absolutely round.  There was not another light in the sky ‚Äì no stars, no planets and the sky was still filled with light from the sun as it was setting. There was a storm rolling in, a tornado watch and the sky was a bit hazy. I doubt that there were many people in my area outside looking up at the time.  I put the binoculars down and picked up my phone to bring up my astronomy app to see if I could identify what it was that I was seeing. As I was fiddling with my phone to bring up the app ( I have to take my case off because it has a magnet on it and that destroys the accuracy of the compass and it doesn‚Äôt work for positioning)  the object started dimming and shrinking in size as if it was now heading away from my perspective. When I saw it dim, I knew the app wouldn‚Äôt recognize this strange object because it was nothing normal about it.  I decided to try to get a picture of it before it was gone and I did snap a few pictures before it disappeared but the contrast between the object and the sky was low for a camera because it was still pretty much daylight. I accidentally took 2 one second videos and they came out better than the pictures. I put the phone down and watched the object as it narrowed down to a point of light and vanished. When the object was heading away it remained perfectly round as shrunk in size and brightness.  In the two short videos you can see the effect of the atmosphere as it distorts the shape of the object. I am an amateur astronomer and I am very familiar with atmospheric distortion and the distortion I see in the videos tells me the object was above our atmosphere. I wish I could have gotten some photos of it when I first saw it because it was much bigger plus it had a flare at first but I was stunned and was kind of wondering if this was doomsday.  My first thought when I saw the object in my binoculars was that something huge was about to hit earth unannounced. It looked like a rouge moon headed directly for us. When it started moving away, I felt relief as it shrunk in size. I knew that it must be traveling at an extreme speed the way it disappeared. The whole event lasted about 5 minutes. The object pretty much stayed in the same location in the sky and did not jump or dart around. I didn‚Äôt see it come into view ‚Äì it was just there when I looked up and it only moved a little in position when it took off. There was no sound, no flashing light and the only colors I saw was sliver and gray. Since it was hazy during the observation, I have to question the detail that I saw on the object. I now assume that maybe I was seeing cloud vapor super imposed on the object and that vapor gave it the darker areas in the disk I viewed that resembled the terrain of the moon. Now my question is ‚Äì Did anybody else see this object?   My guess was that it was an asteroid making a very close fly-by but the news and the astronomy groups are saying nothing about it.  It‚Äôs seems impossible that no one else noticed it. It‚Äôs a complete mystery to me.",

At approximately 22:50, on the evening of Sunday, the 2nd of May, 2021, I witnessed 2, small but very bright lights traveling at a very high rate of speed traveling in a westerly direction coming from over land and heading out over the Gulf of Mexico. At first I thought I was witnessing two meteors as they were traveling much faster than any aircraft or other man made object could.  I tracked them for approximately 20 seconds in a straight line. Both objects were traveling side by side, in the exact same direction and speed. At that time, both objects made four very distinct course corrections. Both objects made the same zig zag, ‚Äúz‚Äù  shaped movements. First to the right, back to the left, back to the right and finally left continuing westerly in a straight line and at a burst rate of speed before disappearing.  The speed, distance apart and the movements were identical and did not very from the each other. Due to the precision, speed of the movements and rate of acceleration, I am confident these were a form of mechanical objects that were neither a man made or natural objects.",

   "text": "Unusual path and abrupt changes of direction by a star-like object in the sky On Sunday, May 2 at around 8:45 PM I was outside on the deck of my significant other's house in Westport, CT with a group of 6 people when I casually looked up to the sky at the Big Dipper.  I saw what, at first, appeared to be a star / plane-like object (yellowish-orange in color) moving fairly normally downwards in the sky near the 2nd star of the Big Dipper handle at roughly commercial airplane altitude.  But then, a few seconds later, what caught my eye was that this object performed a sudden - albeit slight - turn in direction (no more than 30 degrees).  It wasn't a gradual, arc-like turn but rather a pretty sudden turn on a point in the sky.  A couple seconds later, it repeated a similar turn on another point in the sky.  4-5 such turns were made within the span of 15-20 seconds so that after that time the object had completely changed its direction and was now heading upwards in the sky on the other side of the same star of the Dipper...and then it (g! radually) disappeared.  From a physics standpoint, it was as if something had entered the atmosphere, took this unusual path, and then exited the atmosphere.  I am 43 years old and I had never seen anything like this before.  It became obvious that it was neither a plane nor a meteor.  I thought that it could, perhaps, be some kind of satellite capable of making such sudden turns...but I later discovered that such motion was impossible for satellites as well (unless something catastrophic was happening with the satellite).  Just when I thought I'd seen a one-time unusual event...about 5 minutes later I see a similar yellowish-orange object appear just outside the the far side of the Big Dipper pan and slowly making its way under the pan and towards the handle.  This time, I quickly called attention to the object to both my girlfriend and another guest at the gathering (he was about 60 years old) and they both confirmed that the strange object was neither a plane nor a meteo! r.  The object continued on its trajectory across that part of! the sky making a gradual arc (straighter than the first) in that part of the sky until it had passed the Big Dipper handle.  It then gradually disappeared afterwards.  This object's somewhat erratic path lasted 30-45 seconds.",

We had an expansive view and could see many miles in all directions. Our sightings occurred in 3 separate events, as the light would drop below the horizon and reappear again later in a different part of the sky. The light had a gentle pulsing appearance, where the brightness would fluctuate by about +-20%.  The first sighting way at approximately 9pm. The light was moving back and forth across the sky in a zigzag pattern, while also moving up and down perfectly vertical. It would also have erratic bursts of speed where I estimate it would cover many miles in less than 1 second. The light dropped below the horizon and we went inside. The sighting lasted for approx 5-10 minutes.  About 30 minutes later we witnessed a similar light, possibly the same one, in a different part of the sky. It was behaving in the same manner as the first one we saw. This sighting lasted for approx 15 minutes.  30 minutes after the previous sighting another strange light was spotted. This time approx 90 degrees, to the west, away from the initial sighting. This light was much brighter and was white. It was behaving in the same erratic manner as the other lights before. After watching it for several minutes it headed north east and it the erratic behavior ceesed. While the bright white light was moving we also noticed a smaller, seemingly much more distant, light lower in the horizon. That light was red and behaving like the initial light, doing loops and moving in a somewhat random pattern.",

   "text": "Large group of small circular objects The sky was bright blue and clear. As I was preparing an outdoor fire for myself and my 2 kids, I noticed a plane flying off to my east. This is extremely common, as we live in the flight path for DCA. However, beyond the aircraft, at an extremely high altitude was several (12-20) white circular objects all moving together going from south to north just as the plane was traveling. At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it but as I was getting the firewood ready I began to think: this is extremely odd. So, I said to my kids: look at this guys, dad has never seen anything like this. My six year old observed the objects too and we were both puzzled by the I thought maybe they could be weather balloons but I do not believe they are released in such a large number. I tried to take a picture but my iPhone would not zoom that far, these objects were hard to see with the naked eye.",

Then it turned back north and got to 2 o'clock but this time it took only about 5 minutes. Then it turned east at about the same speed as it did when heading north. I lost it in the sun after that. It was highly reflective metal because at times it would glint off the sun. It looked like it had angles more than soft curves.

At 11:15pm mst we noticed a very bright white light off into the distance moving erratically the weird thing was there were vehicle light off to the distance from where these lights where. The strange thing about this the two vehicle lights turned into what appeared to be 4 vehicles that disappeared. There aren't any thing that would mask the \"vehicle lights\" they were lined up in a straight row almost as if the tail lights were pointed in our direction in which cas! e would be impossible for it was on a road not a parking lot.

A car pulls onto the road and stops in front below our cabin. They seem confused as the passenger gets out to look our direction as if they're seeing something we aren't. As we are looking at them the light beams get brighter then shoots away. The passenger gets back in the car and they drive away. Like I said we never got out of the hot tub but my drink koozie is missing, as if we were taken out of the hot tub and put back but not as we were found. The koozie wasn't found until the next morning by the tree that had been flashing with a bright beam the night before. I believe we were 100% visited by aliens. Time was missing and our drink koozie being out of place was a giveaway too. Marks on my body were found the next day as well.",

I would say that I think the distance from which I watched the the object travel is probably a distance¬† of 5 to 7 miles as the crow flies as for my distance i would have to say I was probably between 3 and 5 miles if I were looking at the object directly. It was not fast probably like a cessna plane. As for the color it seemed a tone of gun metal gray but not metalic from my view point. At the time I saw it the sun would have been pretty close to being in front of the direction it was moving.",

The object stayed still for another 5 minutes before turning 90 degrees north and slowly moving off before jetting off at what seemed like light speed and was gone. The object flashed lights on and off in the middle of the day so it couldn‚Äôt have been a reflection. I have a 30 second video of the object hovering in place and flashing lights.

On the evening of April 27th, 2021, I saw an object, Mars was on my left and I was looking straight ahead, but I was looking up, and the object was going straight across and then made a fast circle in the sky went up and then disappeared. On the evening of April 28th, 2021, I saw four objects. Two of the objects were flying one behind the other and then two side by side and then another one. I have also seen the same kind of object flying extremely fast in the sky, and in some cases producing a bright white light. I also have video of this happening but my phone is so crappy that you can't see the objects I am filming. I was hoping that maybe someone had the technology to filter and see these objects so that people do not think that I am trying to play a joke or report a hoax but that this is seriou! sly an ongoing phenomenon that I am witnessing. Thank you and like I said I hope you do not think I am crazy or lying. I would just like some answers. I also have a true story that I have experienced a close encounter of the second kind. Like I said I'm not trying to gain any attention or trying to be someone that I am not or lie about anything. I honestly just want people to believe me and to not think that I am crazy. I have been deemed mentally disabled because of being diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder because people do not believe the things that I am telling them and they think I am crazy or schizophrenic. You can believe what you want to but these things have really happened and I have really seen them. I also have witnesses from the staff that are here at the current mental health group home that I live in. I had them come out to see these things that seem to only happen to me or when I'm around, and they have also seen them to. That is all I have to report I ! am sorry if this is all jumbled together for I do not have Mic! rosoft w ord. I just needed to tell part of my story. There is a whole lot more. I will take lie detector tests or any other kind of test that you would like me to to prove that I am not lying and that these events have really happened. Thank you",

   "text": "On the morning of April 27th, 2021 I was sitting outside smoking cigarettes under my deck at approximately 4:00 in the morning near East Lansing, Michigan. I was looking south and from the position that I was sitting I could see very far out into the sky between some houses and trees. Near the sky line, as far away as I could see I saw a dim yellow light that appeared to be getting larger and brighter as it approached me heading from south to north. Something about it grabbed my attention because it wasn‚Äôt a light similar to any I had seen on any airplane. It wasn‚Äôt blinking and was distinctly yellow rather than the typical white-ish LED color. As the light approached and started to fly overhead I realized that there was an object flying in front of the yellow light. It was a totally black triangle with 3 red lights, one on each corner, that weren‚Äôt blinking and were significantly dimmer than the yellow light. The black triangle was approximately 3 times the size of the light. The ship flew almost directly over top of me and as it did I got a pretty detailed look at exactly what it was. The bottom was a perfect triangle with three completely flat sides and what appeared to be a completely flat black bottom with just the three red lights just inside of each corner of the triangle. There was not a single blinking light underneath just the 3 solid red lights. Traveling in formation behind the triangle was a yellow orb of light. This is the light I had originally seen on the horizon. It seemed to be light emanating from nothing. I can only think to describe it as a large orb of yellow light floating very closely behind the triangle but clearly was not attached to it. I could see the sky in between the triangle and orb and nothing was holding them together but they were flying dangerously close to each other. Too close for any airplanes to fly together. The distance between them was maybe half the distance of a side of the triangle and the distance between triangle and orb never change at all. I stepped into my yard to get a better view while it was directly near over top of me and I could clearly see that the back edge of the triangle was totally flat, ruling out any planes that I am aware of. It was a perfect triangle with all equal length sides. It took approximately 45 seconds for it to pass from one horizon to over top of my head and disappeared over top of my house and I could no longer see it. I struggle to say exactly how big or how far away it was but the triangle was similar to the size the top half of your thumb held away from your face in the sky. I debated whether or not to add this next part in because I worry that it could detract from what I‚Äôve said so far but It‚Äôs true and possibly relevant so I figured I should include it even though I definitely run the risk of losing credibility for saying this and I realize that but I‚Äôm already reporting a UFO so might as well be fully honest. 20 minutes before I first saw it I had a thought that I would see an alien in that exact location in the sky that I first saw it. I‚Äôve never seen anything unfamiliar in the sky before, never had any ghost encounters, never heard anything out of the ordinary, never seen anything that wasn‚Äôt ordinary and explainable in my entire life. I didn‚Äôt even really believe in aliens until I saw what I saw. But I had a thought that I would see a ship coming from the exact place in the sky that it came from just 20 minutes before I first saw it. When I first saw the light far out in the distance it did not appear to be moving but with it tha! t far away it‚Äôs hard to tell. After initially seeing a strange glowing light in the sky exactly where I thought I would, I then began thinking that I hope it comes towards me and it did. I was actively thinking that I hope it comes to me as I began to see it move in my direction. It went from maybe 15 miles away and came almost directly over top of me. I‚Äôve never experienced any sort of hallucination, I‚Äôm completely mentally sound, I don‚Äôt take any medications, and I wasn‚Äôt drinking. I don‚Äôt know how my thoughts could possibly have effected whatever flew over top of me but what I saw was certainly real and maybe those strange thoughts were just totally coincidental to what I saw but I‚Äôve never in my life thought that I would see something in the sky until right then in that moment and 20 minutes later there it was, and then immediately after seeing it in the distance I actively thought that I wanted it to come my direction and it came directly over top of me.",

It resembled closely what a satellite might look like if it was more relatively fixed in position.  It moved in an easternly direction, towards the the sun that had yet to rise.  At fist we thought it a plane, but it could not be any commercial or recreational aircraft judging by how fast it appeared to move. We did not hear or feel the sound barrier breaking. We considered the object possibly to be of military or Space X origin, but we, cannot say for certain.  The object soon disappeared within a minute or two.

It was around 1:00 in the morning.I woke up thirsty for a drink so I went into the kitchen to get some water when I noticed a strange white light through the blinds of my window facing the backyard. I set my drink down on the table while I opened the back door leading to the backyard. While I was walking down the concrete path that lead to the end of my back yard to take a closer look at what was going on I heard a foot step in the immediate vicinity. Obviously shooken up I made a b line towards the door which I exited only to be hit by this paralyzing beam of white light. Next thing I know I'm back in my kitchen sitting upright in my chair. All seemed normal until I looked at the clock on the kitchen stove and saw the time was 5:00 am. Not wanting to bring any unwanted attention to myself I decided to keep it quite for the rest of the school day until what happend next. Being a accomplished track runner for my high school I normally find it easy to not get ! fatigued or have anything unusual happen after I'm exhausted Today was unique in that after I felt absolutely sick to my stomich.I told my coach I wasn't feeling well and he let me go use the bathroom.As soon as I made it I threw up in the toilet but this was no normal looking vomit. It had a solid blue like texture and before I knew it this unusual bug like thing was sitting right there on the bottom of the toilet bowl before crawling down the pipe. I believe there was some type of experiment used on me maybe even containing the creature also known formally as the face hugger. Being the dumb guy I am i still considered to keep this to myself since anybody else would not belief me and think I'm crazy.I tried to get photographic evidence but the creature that came out of my mouth moved to fast. As of typing this I have never experienced such a crazy event in my life and still have trouble believing what happend to me. I can't explain why but I did not feel any fatigue at all! while running and was questioned by everyone why I didn't see! m exuast ed like the rest of the group. Whatever that was that came out of me must have left some type of effect that delays the exhaustion period after physical excersion.It is not my intent to spread false information and would never try to trick the person reading this into something thats simply not true. I just want to encourage anybody else that has experienced the same type of events that happend to me to not be afraid to pubically admit it before it is to late. The only power these creatures have over us is the ability to make us doubt our own memory. I hope everyone who is reading this does not have to go through the same events as I did and never have to come in contact with these horryfying beings.",

It seemed too large to be a meteor but was still very high up and far away. The light was a chrome blue and vibrant, never changing color. At first when I fixated on it it was still, like an oversized star. Almost immediately after I registered that thought it shot off quickly and slightly curving away from my position heading directly North. I have seen many meteors in my life and immediately I felt a chill as it was unlike any I had seen. There was also no trail or light distortion as it moved across the sky just a solid light. I lost sight of the light as it passed into the tree line.",

I saw 3 glowing red and orange lights in the dark sky the lights where flats and in a triangle formation they where to low and didn‚Äôt make a sound like jets and planes do when they break the sound Barrier. Then the 3 lights just like rotated in the same shape just facing a different direction. Then the 3 lights just did a weird rotation that the 3 lights came together to a vertical straight line. Then rotated horizontally while it was rotating the middle light just like faded away like vanish and only 2 light stayed in a horizontal shape. I told my brothers at the same time, screaming ‚Äú screaming yo bro dats a ufo, it‚Äôs huge my brother thought it was plan but their just no noise at all, and a plane just couldn‚Äôt be that low.

Winco parking lot we observed 2 of these objects 2 minutes apart moving on same path at relatively low altitude approaching from the west and casually turning Northeast. When approaching we could see yellow orange colored light NOT flashing. When they turned the lights disappeared and we saw a perfectly circular totally black object. It was dusk so there still was some background lighting but this did not resemble a helicopter or plane I've seen. There was no noise from them we could hear. At about 8:35 an airliner was coming in low for approach to PDX to the west. The second object like the first continued NE in a straight line and appeared to fly underneath crossing the plane. I first wondered if this was a balloon but it moved too fast and precisely and considered maybe an ultralight but too fast and they're very noisy but the totally black circular shape was something I have never seen and I follow aviation. My wif! e did capture a still image of one of the objects approaching from the West which is not an approach pattern for planes flying to Portland international airport. That still image shows the lighted object. There's also a video taken after the 2nd object made a turn Northeast though it was easy to see with the naked eye the video may be difficult to see the black circular objects without enhancing because of parking lot lights obscuring the image at dusk. Still pick and video can be submitted if requested. I will note there is a municipal airport in Troutdale Oregon which was in the general direction these objects were moving by the time we lost sight of them moving past the shopping center. The proximity of the second object apparently flying underneath the approaching airliner at low altitude was particularly concerning and they appeared quite close to the point where the FAA should take notice. I would be curious if Portland international or Troutdale airport or the airlin! e reported the object approaching.",

The one to the left was larger in size and brighter than the one to the right. That is when I noticed the one to the right was flashing every four seconds and an expanding ring was moving downward from it after every flash.  I am retired Coast Guard and have seen many types of flares including parachute flares and have never seen anything like this. In the cell phone video, the first part I am right on my driveway, then I back up to the street and try to zoom in for a better view. This is where you can make out the flashing and expanding ring clearer.",

I noticed a lone brightly blinking star of an unusual/changing shape in the night sky, and got my  binoculars. The \"star\" was pulsing sharp bright flashes of red, blue, and green, and multiple colors could be seen at the same time. My roommate witnessed a portion of this phenomenon also. After about 30 minutes it began flashing mostly red. I had put my phone down and turned my back for about 10 seconds to get the phone to take one more video, and when I looked again it was gone.",

   "text": "Green orb making irregular movements in the sky On the night of Sunday, April 18th, 2021, at approximately 9 p.m. I was inside my home washing dishes when I could hear sirens outside of my home. As a few minutes passed, I began to hear even more sirens and police cars gathering close by. I walked outside to the end of my driveway to investigate all of the sirens I was hearing. Across the street from me, there was a small home that appeared to have smoke pouring out of it. Obviously I presumed something was on fire inside the home. I watched roughly eight fire trucks arrive on the scene followed by numerous police cars and three ambulances. My home resides behind my landlord who i'm friends with so i sent her a text message to let her know what was going on. She came outside and greeted me and stood beside me while we watched the events of the fire unfold. We stood at the end of the driveway while we watched the fire fighters try to make an entry into the house. Roughly fifteen minutes after watching them, I noticed what seemed to be a solid green colored star slowly descend from the sky.The closer it became, the less it seemed like a star and more like a green orb. The green orb descended until it stopped right above the scene of the fire. At the time I asked my landlord if she could see the same green orb I did to which she agreed.  When it stopped, we could tell that the object had a round figure to it, also it had some mass to it. You could tell that it was large, and it sat just under the clouds right above the home. The object sat there in mid air not moving for a few moments. Suddenly it started moving side to side very slowly. \tWe continued to watch the object shocked and wondering what it was. We kept asking each other what it could be and we couldn't come up with an answer. The green orb would move slowly in one direction, then in the blink of an eye, shoot straight up into the sky. It was almost impossible to keep up with. The object stayed a solid green color and continued to stay directly above the scene of the house fire. It would come down slowly and hover, then move to the side, then gain altitude and ascend into the sky. All of the movements were irregular and hard to keep up with because of how erratic it was. There were times we could see it right under the clouds almost getting close enough to hover right over the treeline that was behind the house, then it would ascend so quickly into the sky it would look like a distant star all over again. Even when it gained altitude, it would stop in mid air and slowly move side to side, then drop down close. Whatever movement it made it seemed t! o have an interest in the lights or the scene of the house fire. As my landlord and I both watched it, we felt nervous and a little shaken up because of the movements this green orb was making. This was no drone because of the speed and altitude it could achieve in mere milliseconds. This was not a meteor or any kind of man piloted aircraft. It did not have any kind of propelling force that moved the object. There was no fire or smoke behind the aircraft. This object moved across the sky back and forth so quickly and slowly that you could tell it did not abide by the natural law of physics. After watching this green orb for about fifteen minutes it would disappear, then reappear on the other side of the sky. My landlord and I struggled to point out to each other where it was disappearing and reappearing. Eventually after it made its erratic movements and kept moving across the sky, the object just simply disappeared. We watched it do this a few times until eventually it never reappeared in the sky. My landlord and I knew what we had just ! seen was something unexplained. Even now when we talk about it, we get uncomfortable.",

It looked as bright as a distant planet. Suddenly it accelerated, making a downward swoop then quickly regained original altitude, continuing south. The object maintained a steady path for about 8 seconds. It paused briefly coming to a complete stop, then began a 45 degree descent. I assume it was no longer reflecting the sun as it grew dimmer, and disappeared.  I have maritime experience as well as an aviation background. Definitely not a drone or typical aircraft.

   "text": "My girlfriend and I were seated on her 15th floor balcony facing due west towards the adjacent intracoastal waterway.  At approximately 5:52 pm my girlfriend commented on an unknown flying object which was across the waterway, perhaps 1/4 mile west, perhaps a couple hundred feet south of our position and roughly a 20 degree angle in altitude from the balcony.  When I turned my attention I saw a multipointed star shaped object, symetrically bulging in the middle, black in color and intermittently reflecting the sunlight. The object was perhaps 50-75 feet below a small Cessna type single engine aircraft flying northwest. The size was roughly 1/3 of the length of the plane above it.  At first I assumed this was an object being towed under the aircraft as its speed ans direction appeared to match.  What happened next surprised me though as the object deviated towards due north along the waterway and the plane continued on its path.  I then observed the object continuing northward and maintaining relatively level flight. I watched it into the distance and lost visual contact as it appeared to go over the buildings of downtown Fort Lauderdale approximately 9 miles to the north, passing just east of the fort Lauderdale airport.  The entire episode lasted less than 15 seconds. I did not perceive any noise from the object above the background street and plane noise. There was no contrail, visible means of propulsion or anything I would associate with a control surface. I would have thought it was some sort of balloon if not for the speed, horizontal orientation and level flight.  I was able to shoot a few seconds of video at the tail end of my visual contact which I will email separately.",

It looked like a round light in the sky at a distance. Sometimes blinking, sometimes just still. Then one morning i noticed what appeared to be a light hiding in the clouds. I know it sounds strange. It's hard to explain and maybe its all in my mind. It appeared to move very quickly in and out of the clouds. Or almost like sitting on top of the clouds. Very quick and numerous. It looks like two will go into 1 or 1 will seperate into 2...sometimes it is just gone...there are cloud trails sometimes where it punches holes in the clouds...  I would like to really just submit this anonymously and if i can just send you the video footage and pics . I am hoping at the end of this form i have that option.

   "text": "Alerted by my German Shepherd, I saw a very ultra white, very bright round light slowly traveling west. On the night of April 16, 2021, at approximately 9:48pm, I was in my backyard waiting for my German Shepherd to do her business. I was looking at my phone and I noticed she had walked up next to me. As I looked over to her, I saw she was looking up to the sky behind me and she had her head cocked in a manner to say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù  I turned around and looked in the direction she was looking, which was almost true North, and I saw a very ultra white, very bright round light. Although I can‚Äôt say for sure, my initial thoughts were that it was maybe a mile or mile and a half away (using Magnolia Av. to my north as a possible point of reference), traveling slowly in a westerly direction. I quickly brought up my cell phone camera, switching it from photo to video, and hit the record button, as something was strange about this light. My first thought was that it was a drone, however there were no red/green direction lights on it that I could see, and there were no sounds coming from it‚Äôs direction that you associate with a drone‚Äôs propellers, and the size seemed way too big for a drone that distance away.  The object‚Äôs direction of flight took it behind a large tree in the parkway behind and next to my house. I was able to watch it continue westward through breaks in the tree‚Äôs foliage. I could see the moon to the west, also behind the tree. It was in the waxing crescent phase. The object continued and visually appeared to pass to the left and under the moon, where I lost it behind the heavy tree foliage. I tried to position myself to see if it would appear below the tree‚Äôs foliage but I couldn‚Äôt see it anymore. I could only guesstimate the distance it traveled as maybe to Main St., approximately a mile and a half west of me, however it may have continued much farther.  I posted my video on a local social media site, wondering if anyone else had seen it. One female posted she saw it and thought it was a drone. Another female posted saying she saw it from her windows and jumped out of bed. A third female posted the event was ‚Äúfilmed in (the city of) Murrieta too‚Äù (a city 30 miles south). A male posted he also saw it, saying it disappeared fast when he went to take a video. He said he and 2 others reported it to the UFO Reporting Center.

While driving Northbound across the Longview/Rainier bridge, I spotted a white flattened oval shaped object through the girder structure of the bridge. I hoped to myself, \"Watch, it'll probably take off at a high rate of speed the minute I can see it clearly.\" However, once clear of the bridge structure the object was gone completely. I could not see it anywhere in the sky. This was a definite object about the size of perhaps a medium sized plane at approximately 3,000 feet but had no flight characteristics of an aircraft designed for flight in our atmosphere. No wings, no rotors, no balloon. It was a brilliant white but was not illuminated. I saw it in clear sun lit skies. It was also independent of the bridge. In other words not something stuck in the girders. It was an object in the sky that suddenly wasn't there anymore. I wasn't drinking or on any drugs or anything. But I can't explain it other than how I just did.",

After that shot, I zoomed out to 9.61mm and took a second photo from the same stance at f4.5 aperture at the same, photo data recorded 11:32AM and at a faster speed: 1/640 of a sec. I personally did not see the object when I took the photo! When I downloaded the camera there was the object. Then I looked at the second photo and there is no object.

I instantly got a headache and I don't remember even laying down.The next morning I told 3 people I know this sounds crazy,but I gave a specific description,and promised not to mention it unless it comes up,well the NEXT DAY THE PENTAGON spotted a very similar object.I am willing to take a polygraph and I honestly don't feel alone, I feel like a total idiot,but I KNOW what I saw,and I know inside of my house since then, I do not feel alone and am scared for my family, but I noticed very tall shadow movements in my apartments like 7 or 8feet presence and I am totally freaking out. Please help me find peace with this, and I will GLADLY take a polygraph because I know what color, patterns, and moments that I have seen",

Based on an airliner speed of 400-450 knots at altitude moving across the night sky, I would estimate this object was moving close to 1200 knots.  I‚Äôve seen what a satellite looks like moving across the sky, but this object was nearly 4 times the size of what a very small satellite looks like in the sky.  They are very difficult to see.  This was very easy to see.  I don‚Äôt believe it was a satellite.  There was no sound associated with it, no anti-collision lights, nor a contrail and it flew in a straight line northeasterly and dimmed out of view.",

   "text": "Triangular shaped craft with star field camouflage on underside which made no engine noise as it passed overhead. At approximately 10:15 pm on Tuesday April 13 2021, a pair of faint pinpoint lights resembling satellites traveling in formation approached from the south. I have seen the ISS pass overhead before, when a craft had just recently undocked and was slowly moving away, and this was similar, in that the lights were traveling along adjacent parallel paths. As the lights grew closer, I noticed that there was an area of distortion between the two small lights. A faint shimmer of light was projecting forward from each of the lights, angled toward a centerline between the two lights, but not reaching far enough forward to intersect each other. The closer the lights came, the more confusing the distorted image between the lights became until the lights passed directly overhead. At that moment of closest approach, with the object directly overhead, the distortion seemed to resolve into a black triangular shape, with the lights appearing at the trailing points of the triangle. As the craft passed between myself and the stars, it obscured the stars behind it, but there were starlike points of light that were present on the underside of the craft. They did not match up with the stars that were in the background but appeared as though it were a type of camouflage mimicking the starfield. The craft continued north and the distorted area quickly disappeared and the parallel lights faded into the distance shortly thereafter. The entire observation was only about 10 seconds. If the craft was above the atmosphere, it was gigantic and moving very fast. If it was within the atmosphere, it produced no contrail and it was totally silent. No engine noise whatsoever. I checked the NASA website and while there was a resupply and docking on 4/9/21, the orbital path of the ISS was not overhead on 4/13/21. I‚Äôve lived under the flight paths and holding patterns of Logan airport for my entire life and I‚Äôve never seen an aircraft like this before. I am a 68 years old male with an MSHS.  Currently retired, I was a clinical lab supervisor and a registered clinical microbiologist.",

While on a walk around the local school track with my wife at about 2030 hrs I observed in the direction of west-southwest and to the right of the constellation Orion a large bright white flash which lasted 1-2 seconds.  I did not see any identifiable civilian or military aircraft beacon lights. Exact altitude unknown but my guess around 10,000 feet.  At about 2036 a second flash occurred this time in the center of the Orion constellation lasting 1-2 seconds. The. At 2045 a third bright white flash occurred  to the left of Orion. However after the third I observed what looked to be a dull shape remaining at the exact location of the flash. I continued to look at the dull shape then it seemed to go away or disappear.  The light was circular and reminded me of a photographers flash.  My wife did not see the flashes unfortunately. But did collaborate that no civilian or military aircraft was anywhere the vicinity of the constellation. Cannon AFB is located  southwest about 38 miles from us bury they rarely fly on Sunday nights. They do during the week have regular flight training paths over out small town.",

Directly over head I notice a shimmering circle of stars. Looking very much like a heat mirage, only in the clear dark sky. \tSurrounding the shimmering were 8 'lights'? in a semi circle, moving uniformly together. White in color moving  much quicker than night lights move. (2-3x more quickly). The lights traveled in a southern to northern direction. I have many apps to help with night sightings. All aircraft Flightradar24), satellites (Heavens Above) and many star charts.  All the above showed no active. Total time was about 5 seconds and gone. Clearoutside.com reported my site with 10 miles visibility, new moon and Class 2 Bortle (0.18 mcd/m2) \tOf course, I was alone, but contacted you via phone.  \tSteve",
