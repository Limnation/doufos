        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          In 1947, the United States had its first verified crash landing of a
          non terrestrial vehicle that was later covered up by our federal
          government as a weather balloon gone astray. Ever since, the mystery
          surrounding our otherworldly visitors in the skies has grown ever more
          complex. With tens of thousands of sightings each year of unexplained
          phenomena, D.O.U.F.O.S made it their lifeâ€™s mission to log and
          investigate these sightings and continue to have an honest, open
          conversation about visitation from our distant neighbors. Each year,
          the amount of sightings reported from all over the world grow in
          numbers, and the evidence of our planet being a visitation hot spot is
          becoming harder and harder to ignore. All of these sightings share
          repetitive, recognizable characteristics that connect hundreds of
          cultures and dozens of languages with experiences that are left
          unexplained, leaving the heaviest of burning questions - what are
          they? And what do they want?
